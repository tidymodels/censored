`censored` is a [parsnip](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org) extension package which provides engines for various models for censored regression and survival analysis.

## Installation

You can install the released version of censored from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("censored")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tidymodels/censored")
```

## Available models, engines, and prediction types 

censored provides engines for the models in the following table. For examples, please see [Fitting and Predicting with censored](https://censored.tidymodels.org/articles/articles/examples.html).

The time to event can be predicted with `type = "time"`, the 
survival probability with `type = "survival"`, the linear predictor with `type = "linear_pred"`, the quantiles of the event time distribution with `type = "quantile"`, and the hazard with `type = "hazard"`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(censored)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(tidyr)

yep <- cli::symbol$tick
nope <- cli::symbol$cross

mod_names <- get_from_env("models")
model_info <-
  map_dfr(mod_names, ~ get_from_env(paste0(.x, "_predict")) %>% mutate(model = .x))

model_info %>%
  filter(mode == "censored regression") %>%
  select(model, engine, mode, type) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = type,
    values_from = mode,
    values_fill = nope,
    values_fn = function(x) yep
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```
