```{r, child = "setup.Rmd", include = FALSE}
```

`r descr_models("survival_reg", "survival")`

## Tuning Parameters

This model has no tuning parameters.

## Translation from parsnip to the original package

```{r flexsurv-creg}
survival_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("flexsurv") %>% 
  set_mode("censored regression") %>% 
  translate()
```

## Preprocessing requirements

FIXME

## Other details

Note that `model = TRUE` is needed to produce quantile predictions when there 
is a stratification variable and can be overridden in other cases.

FIXME: smooth out the next bit

Also, for the `flexsurv::flexsurvfit` engine, the typical `strata` function 
cannot be used. To achieve the same effect, the extra parameter roles can be 
used (as described above).
